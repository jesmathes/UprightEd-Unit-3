-- Two types of arrow functions are 'concise' body, and 'block' body.

quest re .find
-- .find()
passing in two arguments/attribute c and i in that order. not declaring them anywhere else

syntax for .find()
when you pass arguments into ot

first one is a string ( c )

second one is index ( i )

.find((parameter, index) => {code block}) - index: is optional

((parameter is always a string))

(((parameter is just a placeholder variable)))

so wouldn't be putting a data type there, ex if c= a strring,
but if other data types, like a number, then it would represent that particular data type.

it's expecting a value that's a string.

---can pass an object in as a third.
